# DeepBounty

An extensible bug bounty automation framework.

DeepBounty helps security researchers automate common bug bounty hunting tasks using a plugin system. The server orchestrates scans, collects findings, and sends alerts when misconfigurations, leaks, new endpoints, or vulnerabilities are detected on target scopes.

ðŸš§ This project is currently in development.

## Key ideas

-   Modular by design: extend the core with TypeScript modules via an SDK.
-   Scalable workers: execute scans in sandboxed Docker environments, horizontally scalable.
-   Web UI: modern interface to manage targets and view alerts.
-   Planned: a Burp Suite extension to feed captured requests/JS and build a complete sitemap, enhancing module analyses.

```

## Components

-   Server (Core)
    -   Orchestrates scans and data flow between modules, workers, and the webapp.
    -   Exposes APIs for module integration and real-time alerting.
-   Workers
    -   Execute scanning/analysis in sandboxed Docker environments.
    -   Multiple workers can connect to a single server for resilience and scale.
-   Webapp
    -   Modern UI to manage targets and review alerts/findings.
-   Modules (Plugins)
    -   Extend functionality using the TypeScript SDK to add scanners, analyzers, and automations.
-   Burp Suite Extension (Planned)
    -   Sends captured request data and page JS to the server to enrich analysis and build a full sitemap.

## Tech stack
